# Module8-Assignment
This project involves building an item-tracking program for the Corner Grocer. This program needs to analyze text records of items purchased throughout the day, allowing users to search for specific items, view the frequency of all items purchased, generate a histogram of item frequencies, and backup data to a file.

Project Summary:
I developed an item-tracking program for the Corner Grocer, analyzing daily purchase records to help rearrange their produce section effectively.

Strengths:
I excelled in writing clear, well-documented code, effectively using classes and Maps for organization and efficiency.

Areas for Improvement:
Code optimization and implementing input validation could enhance efficiency and security, respectively.

Challenges:
Generating the histogram was tricky, but I overcame it by consulting resources and experimenting.

Transferable Skills:
Skills gained include C++ proficiency, understanding of Maps, class implementation, and problem-solving.

Maintainability and Readability:
I maintained clarity through consistent coding style, meaningful names, thorough documentation, and modularization.
